            Society is at risk due to a rapidly changing climate and change in weather patterns since the 19th century. Climate change has the ability to affect human health, infrastructure, energy, food, and water supply. Although our entire society will be affected by climate change, some groups will be affected more than others. Climate change is likely to affect those who live in regions where coastal storms, drought, and rising sea levels occur. The population of these regions has grown tremendously over the last 40 years as well. Showing that a vast majority of Americans will be highly affected by a rapidly changing climate.

        <p class="bg-light px-2 pt-2 rounded mb-0">
            Looking forward, climate change is anticipated to have a drastic effect on the global economy. By 2050 climate change is projected to reach $8 trillion in cumulative damages. The impacts of climate change will also affect the job market as well. By 2030 80 million full-time jobs are forecasted to be lost due climate change. 60% of these jobs are anticipated to be within the agricultural industry and total losses will amount over 2,400 billion.

        <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
            Due to an increasing worry for climate change over past decades, politics have shifted attention towards this matter. Increasing America’s renewable energy use and lowering our fossil fuel intake could have a great impact on our future climate. Although this has potential to deteriorate the oil and natural gas sector, this is a smarter decision long-term and ultimately will benefit the global economy.

                            <span class="text-danger">Early evidence of climate change:</span>
                                Climate change was first discovered in the 19th century when scientists discovered the greenhouse effect was the cause for ice ages and paleoclimate. The greenhouse effect is how the Earth’s atmosphere traps energy and therefore heats up the Earth. 40 years later a scientist named John Tyndall discovered CO2 emissions have a direct correlation to climate change. If CO2 emissions increase Earth’s temperature will increase.

                                <span class="text-danger">Global Cooling:</span>
                                During the 1970’s scientists believed CO2 emissions were decreasing and we would eventually experience global cooling. Overtime this theory has been proven wrong. John Tyndall believed this theory; however, overtime scientists began to realize just the opposite was happening

                                <span class="text-danger">Global Warming:</span>
                                By 2100, climate experts expect the global temperature to rise by eight degrees Fahrenheit. This minor increase in temperature will have a drastic impact on ecosystems, weather, and all human life. Higher temperature lead to worse natural disasters including storms, heat waves, floods, and droughts.

                                <span class="text-danger">How you can help:</span>
                                In order to minimize the damages of climate change, we all must contribute to a healthier planet. The first thing society should do is convert to renewable energy. Solar and wind energy have been certified by Green-e Energy, an organization that vets renewable options. Next, food and water waste must be reduced. Reducing water waste lowers carbon pollution this is because it takes a lot of energy to treat, pump, and heat water. 10% of U.S energy goes into the process of growing, processing, packaging, and shipping food. Therefore, wasting food is also wasting our energy.

                                <span class="text-danger">Volunteer:</span>
                                Other ways to get involved with reducing climate change include volunteering. Finding advocacy groups in your area are a great place to start for making a change. These groups make all sorts of environmental advances by planting trees, protecting land, helping wildlife, and much more.

                                <span class="text-danger">Vote!:</span>
                                Lastly, the most important way to create change is voting. Voting allows the citizens to change and create laws to better the future of our climate and ecosystems.

                               Heat waves, heavy downpours and sea level rise pose growing challenges to many aspects of life in the Northeast. Infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised. Many states and cities are beginning to incorporate climate change into their planning.

                                Changes in the timing of streamflow reduce water supplies for competing demands. Sea level rise, erosion, inundation, risks to infrastructure and increasing ocean acidity pose major threats. Increasing wildfire, insect outbreaks and tree diseases are causing widespread tree die-off.
