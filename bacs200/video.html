            Society is at risk due to a rapidly changing climate and change in weather patterns since the 19th century. Climate change has the ability to affect human health, infrastructure, energy, food, and water supply. Although our entire society will be affected by climate change, some groups will be affected more than others. Climate change is likely to affect those who live in regions where coastal storms, drought, and rising sea levels occur. The population of these regions has grown tremendously over the last 40 years as well. Showing that a vast majority of Americans will be highly affected by a rapidly changing climate.

        <p class="bg-light px-2 pt-2 rounded mb-0">
            Looking forward, climate change is anticipated to have a drastic effect on the global economy. By 2050 climate change is projected to reach $8 trillion in cumulative damages. The impacts of climate change will also affect the job market as well. By 2030 80 million full-time jobs are forecasted to be lost due climate change. 60% of these jobs are anticipated to be within the agricultural industry and total losses will amount over 2,400 billion.

        <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
            Due to an increasing worry for climate change over past decades, politics have shifted attention towards this matter. Increasing Americaâ€™s renewable energy use and lowering our fossil fuel intake could have a great impact on our future climate. Although this has potential to deteriorate the oil and natural gas sector, this is a smarter decision long-term and ultimately will benefit the global economy.
