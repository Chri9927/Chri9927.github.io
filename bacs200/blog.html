            Society is at risk due to a rapidly changing climate and change in weather patterns since the 19th century. Climate change has the ability to affect human health, infrastructure, energy, food, and water supply. Although our entire society will be affected by climate change, some groups will be affected more than others. Climate change is likely to affect those who live in regions where coastal storms, drought, and rising sea levels occur. The population of these regions has grown tremendously over the last 40 years as well. Showing that a vast majority of Americans will be highly affected by a rapidly changing climate.
